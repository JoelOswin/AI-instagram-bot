# AI Instagram Bot
with <b>instagrapi</b> and <b>Gemini</b><br>
Hello everyone :smile: 
I wrote a simple script for creating your very own AI avatar on instagram :wink: <br>
### Instructions
The main.py script combines my generate_image.py script with instragrapi api to create a new AI profile on instagram<br><br>For instructions on how to setup generate_image.py script in your system, check out my repository: <br>https://github.com/JoelOswin/AI-image-generation <br><br>For setting up instagram bot, you need to create a instagram account obviously. <br><br>Then you need to create two environment variables called INSTA_USERNAME and INSTA_PASSWORD with username and password as values respectively. <br><br> If you need pointers on setting up environment variables. Check out my repository: <br>https://github.com/JoelOswin/AI-image-generation <br><br>Run this command in cmd to install instagrapi:
```bash
pip install instagrapi
```
In the images directory, paste the image of your AI avator.<br><br>Finally, Setup cron or task scheduler(windows) to periodically run main.py and post on instagram :smile: <br><br>If you made this far and found my repo useful, please consider giving me a star :star: <br>
<b>Thank you :) </b>
